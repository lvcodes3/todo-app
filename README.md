# To Do App

Made with React - TypeScript and styled-components for CSS styling.

We also utilize the singly linked list data structure which holds all the tasks (as nodes)
in the to do list.

## Features:

1. Insert a Task

2. Mark a Task as done (removes it from the list)

3. Clear List (removes all tasks from the list)

4. Reverse List

5. Get the List Size

All the features utilize the singly linked list, which is instantiated in the Controller
component, which then holds the components it controls: TaskInput, TaskList, and
Task List Buttons inside of the TaskList.
